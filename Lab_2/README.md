Credit Card Form Application
A dynamic React Native application for handling credit card inputs with real-time validation, dynamic card type detection, and animations. It features an overlapping layout where the card partially overlaps the form, placeholder formatting for incomplete card numbers, and a flip animation for viewing the CVV field. Perfect for demonstrating modern UI interactivity and validation.
